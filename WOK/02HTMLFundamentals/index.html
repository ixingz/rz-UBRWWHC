      The scent of worn panties is a unique and powerful aroma. It's a mix of
      pheromones, sweat, and the natural fragrance of the person who wore them.
      Some people find this smell incredibly alluring and erotic, while others
      may not be as fond of it. No matter what your personal preference is,
      there's no denying that the smell of panties can be a deeply intimate and
      evocative experience.

      "Hey there, could you please give my pits a sniff and let me know if they
      smell okay? I don't want to offend anyone with body odor today."

      I didn't get to respond or react as she placed the foot on my shoulder
      behind my head and jammed the toes from her other foot into my mouth. I
      let out a muffled moan of disbelief as i struggled to get away. She held
      on firmly as her toes tried to grab my tongue. My mouth being gagged by
      her foot left my nostrils to a full on assault from her feet. The smell
      was intense and the more i struggled, the firmer her grip got until
      finally i just gave up.
